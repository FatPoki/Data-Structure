# Arrays

## Overview
An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, each identified by an index or key. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable and are a fundamental aspect of many programming languages.

## Properties of Arrays
- **Fixed Size**: The size of an array is defined at the time of creation and cannot be changed.
- **Indexed**: Elements in an array are accessed using an index. The index of the first element is typically 0.
- **Homogeneous**: Arrays store elements of the same type.
- **Contiguous Memory Allocation**: Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations, making it efficient to access elements using the index.

## Common Operations on Arrays
### 1. Traversing
Visiting each element of the array one by one.

### 2. Insertion
Adding an element to the array. If the array is full, a new array needs to be created with a larger size.

### 3. Deletion
Removing an element from the array. This involves shifting elements to fill the gap left by the removed element.

### 4. Searching
Finding the index of a specific element in the array. Common searching algorithms include:
- **Linear Search**: O(n)
- **Binary Search**: O(log n) (only applicable to sorted arrays)

### 5. Updating
Changing the value of an existing element in the array.

## Example Code
### Array Declaration and Initialization
In most programming languages, arrays can be declared and initialized as follows:

#### Python
```python
# Declaration and initialization
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Accessing elements
print(arr[0])  # Output: 1
